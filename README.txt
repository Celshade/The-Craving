# A text-based, escape-the-room, adventure game

Aloha!!

This is the first game that I've ever built, so please pardon the lack of swag.
I built this mainly as a way to test my [python] programming knowledge,
thus far. I haven't been coding all that long, so I wanted to try out various
techniques and work on my flow. The game took me roughly three months to
complete. I believe it could have been finished much quicker; however, working
full-time, and maintaining a household, doesn't leave me ample free time.
I still have a few updates planned; so, if you've found yourself here and are
curious, please stay tuned.

I truly appreciate all of you who take the time to play through the game. Any
and all feedback is extremely appreciated. If you like the game, or at least
find it interesting, please share it with a friend and keep an eye out for more!
Thanks, again, and I hope you enjoi the journey!
Peace!!

that "enjoy" is spelled incorrectly. It is a personal preference directly
