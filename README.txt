Aloha!!
Kudos, if you're actually reading this. You deserve a freshly baked cookie!
This is the first game that I've ever built, so please pardon the lack of swag.
I built this mainly as a way to test my [python] programming knowledge, thus far.
I haven't been coding all that long, so I wanted to try out various techniques and work on my flow.
Overall, the game took me exactly two months to complete but I do still have a few updates planned.
I believe it could have been finished much quicker; however, working full-time doesn't leave ample free time.
I truly appreciate all of you who take the time to play through until the end.
If you like the game, or at least find it interesting, please share it with a friend and keep an eye out for more!
Thanks, again, and I hope you enjoi the journey!
Peace!!
