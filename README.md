**Aloha!!**

This is the first game that I've built, so please pardon the lack of swag.
I've developed this as a way to test my [python] programming knowledge,
thus far, and work on my flow. The first, fully, playable version took roughly
three months to complete; however, I believe it could have been finished
much sooner - given the time. I still have a few updates planned; so,
if you've found yourself here, and are curious, please take a look at the
wiki and stay tuned!

I truly appreciate all of you who take the time to play through the game. Any
and all feedback is _extremely_ appreciated. If you like the game, or at least
find it interesting, please share with a friend and look for more to follow!
Thanks, again, and I hope you enjoi the journey!

_For the sake of being thorough, as most of you do not know me, I am aware
that "enjoy" is spelled incorrectly. It is a spelling preference, which I've
long since adopted into my personal projects, out of respect for the company
known as *enjoi._

Peace
