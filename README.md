This is the first game that I've built, so please pardon the lack of story
swag and simplicity. I developed this as a way to test my [python]
programming knowledge and work on my flow. The core of the game took roughly
three months to complete; and, since then, I have polished and added features
whenever time was available.

I truly appreciate all of you who take the time to play through the game. Any
and all feedback is _extremely_ appreciated. If you like the game, or at least
find it interesting, please share it with a friend and look for more to follow!
Thanks, again, and I hope you enjoi the journey!

_For the sake of being thorough, as most of you do not know me, I am aware
that "enjoy" is spelled incorrectly. It is a spelling preference, which I've
long since adopted into my personal projects, out of respect for the company
known as *enjoi._

Peace
