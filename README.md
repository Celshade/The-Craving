# The Craving

_A text-based, escape-the-room, adventure game_

***

**Aloha!!**

This is the first game that I've ever built, so please pardon the lack of swag.
I've built this mainly as a way to test my [python] programming knowledge,
thus far. I haven't been coding all that long, so I wanted to try out various
techniques and work on my flow. The game took me roughly three months to
complete. I believe it could have been finished much sooner; however, I haven't
had ample free time. I still have a few updates planned; so, if you've found
yourself here and are curious, please stay tuned!

I truly appreciate all of you who take the time to play through the game. Any
and all feedback is extremely appreciated. If you like the game, or at least
find it interesting, please share it with a friend and look for more to follow!
Thanks, again, and I hope you enjoi the journey!

_For the sake of being thorough, as most of you do not know me, I am aware
that "enjoy" is spelled incorrectly. It is a personal preference, which I've long
since adopted, out of respect and admiration for the company known as *enjoi._

Peace
